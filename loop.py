# for variable in range(start, end, step)
#   code to loop

# range(start, end, step) where start, end, step are numbers [ ex. range(1, 5, 2)]
# From start to end-1(end not included), put the increased/decreased value by step into a variable and loop.
# Don't necessarily have to enter the start and step.
# If start is not entered, 0
# If step is not entered, 1
# range(5)          => start and step not entered
# range(0, 5)       => step not entered
# range(0, 5, 1)    => standard


# for i in range(0, 5, 1) :   # repeats 5 times with i taking values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
#     print(i)                # use variable in the repeated code

# for i in range(0, 5, 1) :
#     print('hello')          # do not use variable in the repeated code

# Print odd number from 1 to 100

#     print(i)

# Print multiples of 5 from to 100
# for i in range(5, 101, 5) :
#     print(i)

# Print perfect squares up to 10000 print(x*x)
for i in range(1, 101, 1) :           #101
    print(i*i)
