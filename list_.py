# variable = ["value", value]   => The data type of the value does not matter
# Use in the above form
# List is a collection of multiple data types in order in one variable.
# The order of values start from 0 => It is called the index number
# When bringing in list values, refer to them using []

# list1 = [1, 'cit', True]
# print(list1)
# print(list1[0]) # Get list1 index number 0 value.
# print(list1[2]) 
# print(list1[3]) # Get list1 index number 3 value. There is index number 3, so an error occurs

# You can use the index number to modify the value at that index number.
# Changing the value can be done as if saving the value in a variable.
# a = [1, 'cit', True]
# print(a)

# a[1] = 'hello'  # Change the value of the index number 1 of a
# print(a)

# print(list1)

# print("Q1. Change the 1st element of list1 to 'park'.")
# list1[1] = 'park'
# print(list1)
# print()

# print("Q2. Name the variable 'arr' and save the list below. [4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32]")
# arr = [4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32]
# print(arr)
