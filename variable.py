# Data types
# str   -> String   => made up of quotes " "  ' '
# float -> Float    => no quotes and has a decimal
# int   -> Integer  => no quotes and no decimal point
# Everyday words (English, Chinese, Korean, etc.) without quotes => error

# a = 10      # saves the integer 10 in the variable a
# b = 'cit'   # saves the string 'cit' in the variable b

# name = 'Yuna'
# age = 12
# height = 147

# print('text' or variable or number)
# The print() function prints the 'text', number, or value of 
# the variable inside the bracket and then adds a newline.
# To print multiple items, use a comma (,)
# If you use print() with nothing inside, ir prints an empty line

# name = 'Yuna'
# age = 12
# height = 147
# print(name)
# print() # prints an empty line
# print(age)
# print(height)
# print('hi')
# print()
# print(5)
# print(5*10)
# print(name, age, height, "hello")
